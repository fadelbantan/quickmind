💡 Why I Built This
This is my first ever hackathon project, and I wanted to build something I’d actually use. I’ve always needed a quick way to jot down ideas without the friction of clunky interfaces, so I made QuickMind.

The goal was speed, simplicity, and keyboard-first design. Now I use it to plan everything from project ideas to this README :)
